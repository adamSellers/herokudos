# Herokudos

This project was build with Angular-cli and is served with Express. 

It's a simple Todo app with a Heroku postgres backend and the lightning design system on the front end. 

## To Build Locally

- create Heroku postgres instance and copy DATABASE_URL
- fork it!
- npm install
- add a .env file in the root directory with your DATABASE_URL value
- node ./models/database.js (first time only, this will build your DB table)
- ng build
- npm start

it will then be up on localhost:3000

## other stuff soon..
